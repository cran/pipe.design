Version 0.3 (24th July 2015)
-------------
* Fixed a bug where program crashes if prior.med is not specified (thanks to Jing Hu for reporting this)
* pipe.design returns an object "rpII.list" listing all the recommended Phase II dose combinations for each simulation


Version 0.2 (12th May 2015)
-------------
* Allows non-diagonal escalation in combination with a neighbouring or no.dose.skip constraint
* Uses a new optimsation algorithm to calculate beta a and b parameters from median and sample size. Previous version did not converge for large sample sizes.
* Clarify in the help files that the recommendation percentages are the percentage of times each dose combination is recommended over the total number of recommended combinations in the simulated trials (which is often more than N)


Version 0.1 (18th March 2015)
-------------
* First release.
